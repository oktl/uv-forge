    disabled Build Project button until path and name are valid

        includes info about the new project 
    added a SnackBar to show build result status
    added keyboard shortcut to build button - Ctrl+Enter / Cmd+Enter
    updated tooltips for most UI controls

Made it so we can create both a framework UI and other project type

    added a template for pyproject.toml that
